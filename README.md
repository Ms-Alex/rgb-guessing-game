# The RGB Guessing Game
> Guess which tile contains the correct RGB color that's displayed!

Created using React. You can test out your RGB color skills in this game, by choosing the correct tile. There are two difficulty modes: Easy contains only 3 tiles to guess from, and HARD mode contains 6 tiles. Just a heads up: the game starts on HARD mode.

Future potential updates: Add a 60 second timer, and a backend to persist top scores.
